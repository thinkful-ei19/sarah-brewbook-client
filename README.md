Chewie's Daily Tracker

The Brewbook application serves as a place for brewers keep a list of beers they have brewed. Once users register for an account they can add new beers to their list including the beer’s name, recipe and any brewer’s notes they might like to include. Brewbook also includes a calculator to make helpful calculations including ABV, apparent attenuation, and calories.
